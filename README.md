This is a soldering kit for to be distributed at the Playa Circuit Booogie Camp at Burning Man 2017. Our goal was to design a soldering kit that does something a little bit more interesting than simply blinking lights while still costing less than a few dollars each. Only one color LED is initally lit after assembling the kit, and users must find another person to "share" their color with and receive new colors in return to light up the rest of the LEDs! Each device can only receive one color from each other device, and communication happens using infrared light.

### SMT Pre-assembly Notes
The surface mount components will be pre-populated to facilitate assembly at the Playa.
- The surface mount battery holders are a bit weak and tend to pop off the circuit board, sometimes bringing the pad with them. You may want to further secure them with a dab of epoxy.
- For aesthetic reasons, surface mount component names are not included in the bottom silkscreen. The component locations are shown below for your convenience.
